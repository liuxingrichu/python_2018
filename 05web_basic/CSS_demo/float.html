                A man was blissfully driving along the highway, when he saw the Easter Bunny hopping1 across the middle
                of the road. He swerved to avoid hitting the Bunny, but unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of his
                car and was hit. The basket of eggs went flying all over the place.
                <br>
                The driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to the side of the road, and
                got out to see what had become of the Bunny carrying the basket. Much to his dismay, the colorful Bunny
                was dead. The driver felt guilty and began to cry.

                A woman driving down the same highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. She
                stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong.
                <br>
                "I feel terrible," he explained, "I accidentally hit the Easter Bunny and killed it. There may not be an
                Easter because of me. What should I do?"
                <br>
                The woman told the man not to worry. She knew exactly what to do. She went to her car trunk, and pulled
                out a spray can. She walked over to the limp, dead Bunny, and sprayed the entire contents of the can
                onto the little furry animal.
